        <h4>Here's a time line of Lincoln’s life:
        </h4>
        <ul>
        <li><span>1816</span>The family moves to Indiana, where Lincoln’s father builds them a cabin. The family farms, fishes, and hunts</li>

        <li><span>1818–19</span>Lincoln’s mother dies when he is nine years old. His father remarries the next year, and Abraham gets along well with his stepmother. Neither his father nor his stepmother can read much, but his stepmother encourages him to learn. He is rarely able to attend school, but he loves reading.</li>
           
            <li><span>1830</span> At age 21 Lincoln helps his family move to Illinois by driving their team of oxen on the 200-mile (320-kilometer) trek. In the next years he works splitting rails (in other words, cutting up logs to make fences) and as a postmaster and member of a boat crew.</li> 
        <li><span>1832–34</span>Lincoln runs for his first political office, in the Illinois state legislature, and loses. He wins election in his second attempt, in 1834, and then wins reelection three times thereafter</li>
        <li><span>1836</span>  Lincoln becomes a lawyer, taking on cases involving everything from small disputes to murder. During a murder trial a witness says that he could see Lincoln’s client commit the crime in the bright moonlight. Lincoln wins the case by proving that the Moon had set on that date and time, and therefore it was too dark for the witness to see anything.</li>
          
        <li><span>November 4, 1842</span> At age 33, Lincoln marries 23-year-old Mary Todd after a long courtship and a broken engagement. They go on to have four sons, only one of whom lives to adulthood.
        </li>
        <li> <span>1846–49</span>
            Lincoln wins election to the U.S. House of Representatives. During his two-year term, he introduces legislation to end slavery in the District of Columbia.</li>
        <li><span>1854</span>
            The Kansas-Nebraska Act, which proposes allowing settlers in Kansas and Nebraska to decide whether they will allow slavery in their territories, brings Lincoln back into politics.</li>
        <li><span>1858</span>
            Lincoln runs for the U.S. Senate and holds a series of debates with Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Although Douglas holds on to his Senate seat, Lincoln becomes well-known for his speeches and beliefs.</li>
        <li><span>1860</span>
            Lincoln wins the presidency on November 6, defeating three other candidates. Alarm spreads through the Southern states. They fear that Lincoln will abolish slavery. They decide to secede from, or leave, the Union. South Carolina becomes the first state to secede from the Union on December </li>
        <li><span>1861–64</span> The American Civil War rages, claiming as many as 850,000 lives from battle and disease. Although the Union has more people and more soldiers, the Confederates win military victories early in the war. Eventually, the Union prevails. Lincoln earns the nickname “The Great Emancipator” for his role in bringing about the emancipation of the slaves. He also wins reelection in 1864.
        </li>
        <li><span>April 14, 1865 </span>Pro-slavery advocate John Wilkes Booth shoots Lincoln during a theater performance. Lincoln dies the next morning. “Now he belongs to the ages,” his secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, reportedly says.
